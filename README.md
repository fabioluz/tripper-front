# Tripper Front

Tripper Front is the frontend application for the [Tripper](https://github.com/fabioluz/tripper) project.

It is written in PureScript, using [Halogen](https://github.com/purescript-halogen/purescript-halogen) as UI framework for studying and testing concepts.

*Inspired in [Real World Halogen](https://github.com/thomashoneyman/purescript-halogen-realworld)*
